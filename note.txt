Day 1:
Created project structure.

Day 2:
1. Passwords are read from a file to simulate real-world attacks.
2. Attempt counter helps track repeated login failures.
3. Account lock prevents unlimited brute force attempts.
4. Locking improves system security.

The error occurred because Python searches for files relative to the
current execution directory. If the file path is incorrect or the
file is not in the same directory, Python cannot read it. and also once you create Passwords list make sure them to save it

Day 3:
1. Time delay slows down brute force attacks and reminds attackers that
   unlimited attempts are not allowed.
2. Password hashing ensures passwords are not stored or compared in
   plain text.
3. SHA-256 hashing improves security by protecting sensitive data.
